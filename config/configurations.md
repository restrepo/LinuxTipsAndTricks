## bluetooth headset connects but not showing in sound settings
See [here](https://askubuntu.com/a/1301449/678974): The proposed solution thatis to set option ControllerMode to bredr in file `/etc/bluetooth/main.conf`
```bash
# Restricts all controllers to the specified transport. Default value
# is "dual", i.e. both BR/EDR and LE enabled (when supported by the HW).
# Possible values: "dual", "bredr", "le"
#ControllerMode = dual
ControllerMode = bredr
```
When you changed the option restart Bluetooth service
```bash
sudo systemctl restart bluetooth
```
